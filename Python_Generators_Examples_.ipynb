        "A generator expression is a compact way to create a generator object in Python. It is similar to a list comprehension, but instead of creating a list, it creates a generator that produces values on-the-fly. Generator expressions are enclosed in parentheses and are defined in a similar way to list comprehensions, with a for loop and an optional if statement."
